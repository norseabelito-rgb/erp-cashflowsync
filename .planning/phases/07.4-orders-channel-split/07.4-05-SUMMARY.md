# Phase 07.4 Plan 05: Temu Placeholder Summary

**TemuPlaceholder component showing "Urmeaza sa fie implementat" message with Construction icon, integrated into orders page conditional rendering**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 20 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-03T00:11:37Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-03T00:31:21Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Created TemuPlaceholder component with Construction icon and Romanian text
- Integrated placeholder into orders page with channelTab conditional
- Hides filters, selection bar, and order table when Temu tab active
- PageHeader and ChannelTabs remain visible for navigation

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create TemuPlaceholder component** - `f054356` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate TemuPlaceholder into orders page** - `8ecd6b1` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/orders/temu-placeholder.tsx` - Placeholder component with Construction icon and Romanian messages
- `src/app/(dashboard)/orders/page.tsx` - Conditional rendering when channelTab === "temu"

## Decisions Made
- **Construction icon**: Used Construction from lucide-react as it clearly indicates "under construction/coming soon"
- **Romanian without diacritics**: Text uses "Urmeaza", "functionalitate", "planificata" (no diacritics) for consistency with codebase
- **Card wrapper**: Used Card component to match other content blocks on the page
- **Keep tabs visible**: PageHeader and ChannelTabs remain visible so users can navigate back to other channels

## Deviations from Plan

### Concurrent Execution Context

**[Rule 3 - Blocking] Integration coordinated with Plan 01 parallel execution**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Integration into orders page)
- **Issue:** Plan 01 (ChannelTabs) was being executed concurrently by another process, creating shared state/dependencies
- **Outcome:** Task 2's conditional rendering was implemented alongside Plan 01's ChannelTabs integration
- **Impact:** No negative impact - the channelTab URL state and conditional rendering work correctly
- **Note:** This is documented because `depends_on: []` suggested independence, but practical execution showed dependency on channelTab state

---

**Total deviations:** 1 contextual (concurrent execution coordination)
**Impact on plan:** Integration completed successfully. The channelTab state from Plan 01 enabled the Temu placeholder conditional.

## Issues Encountered
- **File modification conflicts**: The orders page was being modified by parallel Plan 01 execution, requiring careful coordination
- **Resolution**: Verified final state includes all necessary changes and compiles correctly

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Temu tab now shows placeholder instead of empty/error state
- Ready for future Temu integration to replace placeholder with actual functionality
- ChannelTabs and placeholder pattern established for any future channel additions
