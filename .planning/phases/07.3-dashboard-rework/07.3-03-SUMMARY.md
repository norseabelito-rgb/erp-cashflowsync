# Phase 7.3 Plan 03: Stat Card Tooltips Summary

**InfoTooltip integration in StatCard with Romanian explanations for all 8 dashboard metrics**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-03T10:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-03T10:04:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Extended StatCard component with optional tooltip prop
- Added Romanian explanations to all 8 stat cards
- Users can now understand "De Procesat" = PENDING + VALIDATED nefacturate
- Users can now understand "Expediate" = comenzi cu AWB in tranzit

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Extend StatCard component with tooltip support** - `ce92d32` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add Romanian tooltip text to all stat cards** - `449ba27` (feat)

## Files Modified
- `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added InfoTooltip import, tooltip prop to StatCard, and Romanian tooltips to all 8 stat cards

## Decisions Made
- tooltip prop is optional (undefined renders no icon) - keeps StatCard flexible
- InfoTooltip positioned side="right" to avoid overlap with card content
- All Romanian text without diacritics per existing decision 06-06

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
