## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Audit phase first before any fixes (understand before changing)
- Roadmap: Invoice series fix prioritized as biggest pain point (Phase 2)
- Roadmap: Task management after core fixes (Phases 7-8)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From codebase analysis (CONCERNS.md):
- Monolithic components (orders/page.tsx 2301 lines) - may slow audit
- Invoice series auto-correct has edge cases - verify in Phase 2
- No transaction handling for order processing - address in Phase 4/5
- No integration tests for RBAC - affects QA phase
